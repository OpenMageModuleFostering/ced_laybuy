Integration Process

The Lay-Buys gateway has a simple and flexible design. With minimal technical knowledge, your shopping cart can be integrated into the Lay-Buys gateway fairly easily.

Just 5 easy steps and you too can be offering a flexible, affordable payment plan in LAY-BUY to all online shoppers and where all payments are processed by PayPal. The following 5 steps show how the Lay-Buys gateway works:

    Register an account in our Lay-Buys Virtual Terminal (VT)

    You can register an account HERE.

    Enter your PayPal API signature

    Simply copy and paste your PayPal API signature into your VT account.

    Submit a form with five mandatory fields

    On the checkout page of your shopping cart, five mandatory input fields is required. When the LAY-BUY checkout button is clicked, the information is submitted to our gateway.

    The five mandatory fields are:
        MEMBER - a unique ID is allocated once you register an account in VT
        RETURNURL - the URL of your shopping cart after a successful transaction
        CANCELURL - the URL of your shopping cart after a cancelled or failed transaction
        AMOUNT - the total sale amount of the transaction checked out
        CURRENCY - the currency of the sale, in format of the 3-digit International currency symbol (AUD, USD, GBP, etc.)

    The complete set of input fields can be found HERE

    When choosing, the checkout button, it is strongly recommended that our PUT IT ON LAY-BUY button (Figure 1) should be used. Although it is optional, our button provides the similar look and feel to other PayPal checkout buttons, that may increase the customer's confidence in purchasing products on your site. The image can be downloaded HERE.

    (Optional) Update your shopping cart database using the returned information from the Lay-Buys gateway

    Once transaction is completed, the Lay-Buys gateway returns information about the payer personal details as well as the payment plan. This information can then be stored in your shopping cart database if required.

    Seek an approval from Lay-Buys when your cart is ready to be in production

    Before a real transaction is processed, you must seek an approval from Lay-Buys.

    Check progressive payments
    Once a transaction is complete, merchants can check the payment progress in their Lay-Buys VT account, while your buyer can check the payment progress in the Lay-Buys member's control panel.
